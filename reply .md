# Reply to Alice - Issue with Website Accessibility

Hi Alice,

I have investigated the issue with your website site.recruitment.shq.nz, and here is what I found:

## Issue Summary
When trying to access the website, the browser displays the following message:
> "Unfortunately this website doesn’t exist yet, is offline, or something has gone a bit wrong. Maybe try again later, or if this is your website and you believe you are seeing this message in error get in touch with our support team, we will be happy to help."

This error usually indicates a problem with the website's DNS settings, server configuration, or that the website is not properly set up on the server.

## Steps Taken and Findings

1. DNS Lookup:
   - I performed a DNS lookup for site.recruitment.shq.nz and found that it is not resolving to the IP address 120.138.30.179 correctly.
   - This suggests that there might be an issue with the DNS records.

2. Server Reachability:
   - I pinged the IP address 120.138.30.179 and confirmed that the server is online and reachable.
   - This indicates that the server itself is functioning, but there might be a misconfiguration with the domain's DNS or web server setup.

3. Website Configuration:
   - It appears that the website might not be properly configured on the server. The generic error message suggests that the web server cannot locate the site’s files or the site hasn’t been set up yet.

## Recommended Actions

1. DNS Configuration:
   - Verify the DNS records for site.recruitment.shq.nz and ensure that an A record exists that correctly points to 120.138.30.179.
   - If you recently updated your DNS settings, please allow up to 24-48 hours for the changes to propagate.

2. Server Configuration:
   - Ensure that the website is correctly set up on the server. Verify that the document root for site.recruitment.shq.nz is correctly pointing to the location of the website files.
   - If this is a new website, make sure all necessary configurations are in place, including creating the virtual host (if using Apache or Nginx) for this domain.

3. SSL Certificate (if applicable):
   - If your site is intended to be accessed via HTTPS, ensure that an SSL certificate is installed and correctly configured.

## Conclusion
Please check the above configurations and let me know if the issue persists. I’m happy to assist further if needed.

Best regards,
Lanka Snehitha
