The Challenge
This challenge is broken into two parts: one in which you will call a few API endpoints to retrieve some information, and one in which you will use this information to help identify a problem with a fictional customer's website.

Getting Started
First you'll need the following ready to go:

An editor or IDE of your choice
One of the following languages: Go, Python, PHP, or Javascript
Git, but if you got this far that shouldn't be an issue ;)
Now you can get started â€“ create a branch of this repo, read the challenge details below and get committing! Try to keep your commit messages concise and comprehensible as we will be looking at them.

Part One - Calling an API
We have provided a simple API that returns information about registered domain names and any DNS records associated with those domains. This API returns data in JSON format and exposes the following endpoints:

/domains/{client_id}: Returns a list of domains registered by the customer with ID client_id including a list of any DNS zones that exist for each domain.
/zones/{zone_id}: Returns a list of DNS records for the DNS zone with ID zone_id
The URL for the API is https://api.recruitment.shq.nz and to access it you will need to provide a key as a query parameter named api_key.

The customer Business Systems International has a client_id of 100. Using the endpoints available to you, the API key h523hDtETbkJ3nSJL323hjYLXbCyDaRZ, and the programming language of your choice, retrieve a list of their domains, and DNS records and print them to the screen.

Keep your code simple, with no (or very few) dependencies and tell us how we can run it to see the result. By the way, the information returned may be handy later.

Part Two - Resolving a Customer Issue
Customers entrust us with their websites, data, and livelihoods. We take this very seriously. This part of the challenge will test your ability to troubleshoot a common customer issue, and communicate your findings to them effectively.

In the file email.md you will find an email from Alice at Business Systems International describing an issue accessing their website. Use the information in the email (and perhaps some other sources), to identify what is wrong with the website and figure out a way to visit it. Remember, the site is deliberately broken, its up to you to figure out what's wrong and how to access it. Once on the site, view the source and retrieve the code hidden in an HTML comment in the <head> of the document. The code will look something like: <!-- This is what you're looking for: SOME_CODE_STRING -->.

In reply.md respond to the customer explaining the issue and how they can resolve it (note that you cannot resolve the issue yourself). Keep your reply concise and make sure you include the code that you retrieved from their site as proof that you managed to see the page.
